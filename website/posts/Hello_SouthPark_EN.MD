# Hello, South Park {.blog_entry_tittle}

This is the first entry of the API development blog.
{.blog_intro}

I have finally decided to treat this API as a living project: while the application is in beta, the API will remain active throughout its development. I believe this has both advantages and disadvantages for me and for users.

- I will be able to work on and test the API in production and receive feedback.
- Greater personal involvement knowing the project is evolving.
- A more professional project with a history of updates and a changelog.
- The opportunity to build a more solid and better-organized project.

The issue is that I cannot guarantee the API will remain fully compatible with changes that arise until we reach version 1; after that I will apply formal versioning.

### Upcoming changes {.blog_subtitle}

For now, the main addition is this development blog, where I will publish API news. It will be available as a web page and in Markdown. In this case the blog is part of the website, not the API. I will continue to treat the website and the API as two independent projects, although they will share versioning: API updates will be independent from website updates.

While I add the remaining characters to the API, I want to optimize the website, add the remaining sections, and improve the visual design. I believe this is a clear development path.

Changes may be somewhat slower, but I prefer to make more consistent, well-planned updates rather than small incremental tweaks.

I will share more updates soon.

### Developer's message {.blog_subtitle}

I recognise that I am building a far more solid project than I expected; I really like how it looks and the possibilities it offers. Although I know many parts can and should be automated, I am enjoying the processâ€”or at least trying to.

I want to treat my projects as if they were my children and give each one the care it deserves. I could focus on small one-off projects, but I prefer to see how something like this evolves over time.

I want to feel proud of what I do and know that the effort invested in a project like this is worthwhile in the medium to long term.
