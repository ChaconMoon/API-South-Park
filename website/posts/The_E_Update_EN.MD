# The E Update {.blog_entry_title}

Read the new post on this development blog, this time about the E update, version 0.2.
{.blog_intro}

## New website update — introducing the changelog {.blog_title}

A new section has been added: you can now view the changelog of updates as they are released, with all changes explained in detail.

You can see it [here](/changelog/Version_0.2).

This changelog aims to present API changes more professionally and to reserve the development blog for discussing development in a more personal way.

## API update. {.blog_title}

- All characters from the series whose name starts with E have been added.
- Episode [329](/api/episodes/329) and the two characters who debuted in it have been added.
- All missing family images have been fixed.
- Two new families have been added: 71 and 72.
- A bug in Bebe Stevens' family assignment has been fixed.

For more details, you can consult the [Changelog 0.2](/changelog/Version_0.2).

## API versioning starts. {.blog_title}

From now on, the API will be versioned according to the content that is added. In this case, this is version 0.2 and will follow the following nomenclature:

- First digit: 0 (Will change to 1 once the API exits beta).
- Second digit: 2 (Will change with each major content update to the API, website update, new endpoint, or new episode).
- Third digit: 0 (Minor data changes or data corrections).
- Hotfix: a hotfix will be applied if necessary to correct something via the database or errors that prevent access to an endpoint or a section of the site.

## Conclusion {.blog_title}

This development blog post has been shorter than usual — not because the update is small, but because I trust the changelog will allow me to present the changes of each update more clearly. In addition, the changelog will be updated retroactively with changes from previous versions.
