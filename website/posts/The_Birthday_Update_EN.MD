## Changes in this update {.blog_title}

### Added today's birthdays endpoint {.blog_subtitle}

This update adds the "todaybirthdays" endpoint that returns all characters whose birthday is the current day, with Stan being the first birthday of the day: October 19th. Here's the link, although it could change: [Today's Birthdays](/api/todaybirthdays).

Finally, a clarification: to calculate this, the server's time and day are used, and it is located in the Netherlands, so the character changes at 0:00, Central European Time.

### Developer's Message {.blog_subtitle}

This update is helping me see if I can work on two small updates simultaneously in different branches of the project. I am currently also developing the update for episode 327. Additionally, working on multiple branches is closer to real development, giving me more experience in steering this project.

See you in the next update.
