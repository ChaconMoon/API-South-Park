# Fortnite Update {.blog_entry_title}

### A Little apology {.blog_subtitle}

_It's been a long time since I released a new update of the API, more than one month, It's been a long month for me, I'm taking an English course to get the level B1 or B2 and I didn't have time to do everything, I will continue developing the API in my free time but until April I'm not going to have time_

## New Endpoints {.blog_title}

2 new endponits have been added:  **"Fortnite Cosmetics and Fortnite Items"**

- Items: `http://<your-ip>/api/fortnite/items/<ID>` 1 or 2
- Cosmetics: `http://<your-ip>/api/fortnite/cosmetics/<ID>` 1 or 33

__*The item "Cheesy Poofs" hasn't been added, but it will be added in a future update*__

### Update review {.blog_subtitle}

This update should have been a small update, but it's bigger than I expected, create a new endpoint is harder than when I started with this project and I developing this project alone, and I don't have resources to spend on it.

I think I won't create a new endpoint soon, my plan for the project is to continue with the characters database or look for a method to increase the project.

This is my biggest and most complex programming project ever, and I must accept It, I would like to have another person to divide the project, but at the moment this is impossible.

I made this update to continue the philosophy of the project, include all about South Park, and that includes the Fortnite collaboration.

The next update will be a new character update but I don't know when I can start it.

**This is the first entry of the devblog that I translated manually, I would like continue doing this to improve my English skills**
