# D White House Update {.blog_entry_title}

Hello everyone. This development entry corresponds to the update that adds episode 328 of the series, characters whose names begin with D, plus a small extra addition that makes this update much more complete.
{.blog_intro}

## Changes in this update {.blog_title}

### New episode (Season 28 Episode 2) "The Woman In The Hat" {.blog_subtitle}

In this update, episode [328](/api/episodes/328) has been added. Three characters made their debut in this episode ([Dan Scavino](/api/characters/657), Melania Trump, and Stephen Miller). Of these characters, the first one has been added because it corresponds alphabetically, the other two will be added once it's their turn in alphabetical order.

As in the previous update, this one brings a change that I had to make to a previous character. In this episode, Stan mentions that he is 9 years old, which is theoretically incorrect since in episode [216](/api/episodes/216) he turns 10, so I don't know if this is an error, I'm surprised they made such a mistake. However, being more recent, I've taken it as valid data and updated Stan's age to reflect the latest episode: [Stan](/api/characters/4)

### All series characters whose names begin with D have been added {.blog_subtitle}

All characters whose names begin with D have been added, ranging from character [543](/api/characters/543) to [657](/api/characters/657). In this case, there isn't much new, all characters who are Doctor (something) have been added, one of the 2 characters who have an alter ego and hadn't been added [Dougie O'Connell](/api/characters/622) as well, so I can now add "General Disarray" and Dougie's other alter egos, leaving only "Mr. Slave" as the character remaining to complete that endpoint.

Perhaps the most important additions are [Donald Trump](/api/characters/616) and [his son](/api/characters/617), this is because they are very important in the current season and could be useful in the future, it's one of the reasons why I consider this the White House update.

### New easter egg (The White House) {.blog_subtitle}

One of the most interesting endpoints of this API is the easteregg, an endpoint that isn't documented as such that allows showing results using certain words, these words aren't in the API documentation, you need to look at the code to know them.

I've added a new easter egg [THEWHITEHOUSE](/api/easteregg/thewhitehouse), this easter egg returns all characters in the API who are currently in the White House, although this easter egg isn't finished yet due to 5 characters that aren't yet in the API: Melania, Miller, JD Vance, Noem and Leavitt (plus those to come in the future). The idea behind this comes from the fact that this plot will continue for another 3 years and I see it necessary to give it space, I might even consider giving it its own endpoint.

And that's all for this update, beyond continuing with the database I'm not sure what to do next. I try to release an update every 2 days, excluding weekends, I'll be thinking for a few days about what new features I could add.

See you in the next patch.
